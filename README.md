# KEKH-Travel-Planner

**Descripition**: I'm not a traveller but i made something for travellers. If you're wondering how my program works look down : ).

**Features**: 
1) We can see graph based representation of locations and routes.
2) Multiple pathfinding algorithms for optimal route selection.
3) User inputs for selecting travel criteria (ex: distance, time or cost).
4) Data storage using files or databases.
5) Display of optimal routes and alternative options. (currently only for lowest cost).

**Things needed**: 
1) Dijsktra algorithm for lowest cost routes.
2) Bellman Ford algorithm for shortest distance route.
3) Floyd Warshall algorithm for shortest time route.
4) cutome made data for test run and showcase.

Btw if you're wondering what does KEKH stands for, you are free to make up your own meaning.
(Hint: It's something in Bangla when expended)
Thanks : )
